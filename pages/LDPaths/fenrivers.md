A relatively straightforward run this. It's a total of 48 miles. Navigation is mostly straightforward, as you are running along the river bank for the most part. There is a fairly unpleasat bit of running along a busy road outside Ely, but most of it is fairly idyllic. I ran it in November, in midweek and unsurprisingly, saw very few people apart from in the towns and villages en-route, such as Downham Market and Littleport.

If you don't want to do the whole thing in one go, it's fairly easy to divide into sections using the Cambridge to Kings Lynn railway line, as this runs pretty much parallel to the route and it's easily possible to travel to Waterbeach, Ely or wherever to pick up where you left off. Obtaining food & drink en-route is also very easy as each of the places you pass through has shops and pubs, and often cafes and restaurants too.
