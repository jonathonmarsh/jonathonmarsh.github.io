Quite a few of the Islands around Britain have public rights of way from one side of the island to another. It's been fun to do these as runs.

To date, I've done the following:

- **<a href="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/islands/isleofman">Isle of Man ›</a>** The Millenium Way, across the Isle of Man (from Ramsey in the North, to Castletown in the South)

- **<a href="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/islands/hebrides">The Outer Hebrides ›</a>** The Hebridean Way footpath, across the Outer Hebrides (from Vatersay in the South, to Stornoway, Lewis in the North)

- **<a href="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/islands/tiree">Tiree ›</a>** Tiree is one of the Inner Hebrides, around four hours by ferry. This was running all the way around the island, rather than just across it.
