The Mallerstang valley is a fairly spectacular valley running from Kirkby Stephen down to the Moorcock Inn. It is the source of the river Eden and the Settle-Carlisle railway and two long distance walking routes pass down the valley. The Mallerstang edge forms the east side of the valley and Wild Boar Fell the west.  David Bellamy described the area as “England’s last Wilderness”.

It contains:

On the west side of the valley

- Wild Boar Fell 708m
- Swarth Fell 681m

On the east side of the valley

- High Seat 709m
- Lunds Fell (or Little Fell) 667m

I'm also including here the following, which is in Garsdale, a little to the south and west of Mallerstang

- Baugh Fell 678m
