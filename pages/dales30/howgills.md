The Howgill Fells are a little different to the other mountains in the Dales 30. They are in the northwest of the national park, separated from the Lake District National Park by the M6 to the west and are situated in the land between the lovely town of Sedburgh which lies to the south of them and the villages of Ravenstonedale and Tebay to the North. The River Lune forms a boundary to the north and west and the River Rawthey to the East. Historically, they were split between the West Riding of Yorkshire and Westmorland.

They have a fairly distinctive sttep, rounded, grassy shape with quite complex topography and were famously described by Alfred Wainwright as a 'herd of sleeping elephants'. Geologically, they are different from the Yorkshire Dales and one consequence of this is that they tend to be grassy and a good surface for walking or running, with plenty of good footpaths. No trudging through peat bogs here.

Five of the Dales 30 are within the Howgills Fells, although there are other peaks well worth climbing which are not part of the 30.

The five are
- Calders at 674 metres
- The Calf at 676 metres
- Fell Head at 640 metres
- Yarlside at 639 metres
- Randygill Top at 625 metres
