_Updated 9 January 2025_

We have been living in beautiful Wensleydale since 2022, having moved there from York. 

We've largely finished 'doing up' the house and I'm now busy with the garden, tree planting and wildflower meadow restoration.

I have rejoined Arm, working on the Architectural Reference Manuals, mostly remotely but regularly visiting the Cambridge & Manchester UK offices.

Still playing various musical instruments, mainly mandolin, and kora. Also still enjoying travel - very slowly edging towards the 100 country mark.

Continuing to do a fair amount of running, including some local fell races and heading towards 500 parkruns (and 100 volunteers)
